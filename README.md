# **Figure Identification using C++ and Neural Networks**

Welcome to my Figure Identification project, a C++ implementation for recognizing and classifying figures in images. This project utilizes a neural network architecture, including components like Activation functions, Dense layers, and Matrix operations, to train and infer on a dataset of images.

## **Files:**

1. **Activation.cpp/h:** Implementation and header files for various activation functions used in neural networks.
2. **Dense.cpp/h:** Implementation and header files for the dense layer, responsible for fully connecting neural network layers.
3. **Matrix.cpp/h:** Implementation and header files for matrix operations, crucial for neural network computations.
4. **ImageProcessor.cpp/h:** Module for processing and manipulating image data, including loading, preprocessing, and feature extraction.
5. **NeuralNetwork.cpp/h:** Implementation and header files for the overall neural network structure, orchestrating the training and inference processes.

## **Usage:**

1. Ensure a compatible C++ compiler is installed.
2. Compile the project using the provided makefile or build script.
3. Run the executable, providing the necessary input data or image files for testing the figure identification.

## **Acknowledgments:**

This project was developed as part of an exploration into computer vision and neural networks in my BSc. studies, aiming to identify figures within images. 
The implementation includes modular components for flexibility and easy extension, making it suitable for educational purposes and experimentation in the field of machine learning.

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with configurations, and contribute to further improvements
